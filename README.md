# [Liuzi's GitHub Pages Site](https://liuzi.github.io)

Welcome to Liuzi's GitHub Pages site, powered by Jekyll and the Chirpy theme. This site is a collection of my learning notes, projects, and tutorials, with a focus on GenAI (e.g., Transformer, Diffusion Models, GAN, etc.) and its applications.

## About

This site is built using the [Chirpy theme-Starter Version](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#option-1-using-the-starter-recommended), which offers a clean and modern design, ideal for sharing content and ideas. The theme is highly customizable and extendable, making it an excellent choice for personal blogs and project showcases.

Setting up the development environment is straightforward. You can use Dev Containers with Visual Studio Code or Cursor IDEs for a seamless experience. For Mac users, it's recommended to use [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) to start the Docker daemon efficiently, ensuring a smooth workflow.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, the Chirpy theme provides the tools you need to create a professional and engaging site.

## Generative Models

One of the key topics I explore on this site is generative models. You can read more about this in my post: [Generative Models](https://liuzi.github.io/posts/generative-models/). This post covers the basics of generative modeling, including:

- The difference between discriminative and generative models
- How generative models work
- Applications of generative models in AI
